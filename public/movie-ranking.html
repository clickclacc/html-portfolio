<h1>The Best Movies According to Julie</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies of All-time.</h2>
<hr> 

<h3>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon </h3>
<p>Michelle Yeoh. It has stunning scenery and cute romance. The selling point here is also the badass fighting scenes and constant action. Good pacing. Strong female characters. </p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Nothing can compare to the wimsy and stunning visuals of a Miyasaki film. There is something about the way he captures childhood perspective while simultaneously throwing his characters into complex and textured worlds.</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>So cute. The resolve of the realtionship at the end and the mother accepting her daughter and becky. A middle-aged women getting to play a complex character. simultaneously being very deep and not taking itself too seriously</p>
